# FIFA-Dataset--Project-1
I used the Fifa 24 dataset from Kaggle. It is for Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program.

Motivation of project
Following the CRISP_DM methodology I used the Fifa dataset to analyse the player attributes.
The dataset is from Kaggle and can be found https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rehandl23/fifa-24-player-stats-dataset

The questions that will be focused on are :
* Ronaldo vs Messi what does the numbers say?
* Which country/region has the most valuable players?
* What else is data telling us ...'
The link to my notebook code can be found https://github.com/Abison1/FIFA-Dataset--Project-1/

Files in the repository
 * FifaPlayer.ipynb - notebook with code
 * player_stats.csv - dataset from Kaggle about fifa soccer players

The following libraries were used:
 - Numpy
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib
 - Seaborn

Summary of the results
